Steve Goodman,City of New Orleans,1971,folk,"Riding on the City of New Orleans, Illinois Central Monday morning rail, fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders, three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail. All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out at Kankakee, rolls along past houses, farms, and fields. Passing 1  towns that have no name, freight yards full of old black men, and 2  a graveyard of rusted automobiles. Good morning, America, how are you? Say, don't you know me? I'm your native son.

Gordon Lightfoot,Early Morning Rain,1966,folk,"In the early morning rain, with a lifetime on my mind. Couldn't find a better way to leave the woman behind. Couldn't find a better way to leave the woman behind. On a downtown bound train, loaded up with pain. Leaving Louisiana, heading for the coast. Wide awake and cold, listening to the stories told. Seems the same old song, a long way from home. In the early morning rain, with a lifetime on my mind. Never thought she'd leave me, never thought she'd leave me behind. Never thought she'd leave me, never thought she'd leave me behind. Train whistle blows, a sad and lonely sound. I'm a hundred miles away from home, and I'm downtown bound. Wide awake and cold, listening to the stories told. Seems the same old song, a long way from home. In the early morning rain, with a lifetime on my mind. Never thought she'd leave me, never thought she'd leave me behind. Never thought she'd leave me, never thought she'd leave me behind."
Leonard Cohen,Suzanne,1967,folk,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river, you can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night beside her. And you know that she's half crazy but that's why you want to be there and she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China. And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her, 1  she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover. And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind, and you know that she will trust you for you've touched her perfect body with your mind. 2  And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water and he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower. And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him he said All men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them. But he himself was broken long before the sky would open, forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone. 3  And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind, and you know that he will trust you for you've touched his perfect body with your mind. 4  Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river and she is wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters. And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor and she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers. 5  There are heroes in the seaweed there are children in the morning they are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever. 6  While Suzanne holds your hand and you want to travel with her and you want to travel blind and you know that she will trust you for you've touched her perfect body with your mind"

If I get there before you do, I'll look for you in the early morning sun. And if I don't see you when I come, I'll sit and wait for you till the evening comes. And if I don't see you when I come, I'll sit and wait for you till the evening comes. Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven lonely days and nights. Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven lonely days and nights. You were on my mind, you were on my mind. You were on my mind, you were on my mind."
Tom Paxton,The Last Thing on My Mind,1964,folk,"Yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrow's out of sight. And it's sad to be alone but it's not the hardest thing in life.

It is well, it is well, Matty Groves he did say Though I'd gladly fight with thee, if I only had the day Get up, get up, Matty Groves, she said, and put on your clothes For it never shall be said that I killed a naked man He put on his clothes and he came downstairs And he fought with her lord for three hours and more But Matty Groves was a brave young man, and a squire of renown And he fought with her lord till the blood did run down But her lord was a treacherous knave, and a cowardly hound And he watched for his chance, and he wounded Matty Groves Oh rise you up, Matty Groves, she said, and take your death wound free For it's better I should have one kiss from your lips than you should have twenty from me Oh rise you up, Matty Groves, she said, and take your death wound free For it's better I should have one kiss from your lips than you should have twenty from me She picked him up in her arms, and she carried him to the stable door And as the blood ran down, she cried, Matty Groves, no more She picked him up in her arms, and she carried him to the stable door And as the blood ran down, she cried, Matty Groves, no more"
Sandy Denny,Who Knows Where the Time Goes,1967,folk,"Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving But how can they know it's time for them to go? Before the winter fire, I shall still be dreaming I do not count the time For who knows where the time goes? Who knows where the time goes? Sad deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving Oh, but then you know it's time for them to go But I shall still be here, I have no thought of leaving I have no thought of time For who knows where the time goes? Who knows where the time goes? And I am not alone while my love is near me And I know it shall be so until it's time to go So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again I do not fear the time For who knows how my love grows? And who knows where the time goes?"

Iron & Wine,Such Great Heights,2003,folk,"I am thinking it's a sign That the freckles in our eyes are mirror images And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate That God himself did make us into corresponding shapes Like puzzle pieces from the clay And true, it may seem like a stretch But it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away When I am missing you to death When you are out there on the road For several weeks of shows and when you scan the radio I hope this song will guide you home They will see us waving from such great heights Come down now, they'll say But everything looks perfect from far away Come down now, but we'll stay I tried my best to leave This all on your machine but the persistent beat it Sounded thin upon listenin' And that frankly will not fly You will hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows with the windows down And this is guiding you home They will see us waving from such great heights Come down now, they'll say But everything looks perfect from far away Come down now, but we'll stay"

Of Monsters and Men,Dirty Paws,2011,folk,"Jumping up and down the floor My head is an animal And once there was an animal It had a son that mowed the lawn The son was an OK guy They had a pet dragonfly The dragonfly it ran away But it came back with a story to say Her dirty paws and furry coat She ran down the forest slope The forest of talking trees They used to sing about the birds and the bees The bees had declared a war The sky wasn't big enough for them all The birds, they got help from below From dirty paws and the creatures of snow La la la La la la la La la la La la la la So for a while, things were cold They were scared down in their holes The forest that once was green Was colored black by those killing machines But she and her furry friends Took down the queen bee and her men And that's how the story goes The story of the beast with those four dirty paws"
